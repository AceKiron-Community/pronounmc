    note: Singular “they” has been used in English to describe an unspecified person since the late 1300s (it's even older than singular “you”!). Nowadays, it's the most popular choice among people who prefer gender neutral forms. It starts being accepted by dictionaries too. It is also common to use “themself” as a reflexive form.

    subject: it

    reflexive: itself
    note: Although “it” is normally used for objects, not people, some actually do like being called that way. If someone wants you to call it “it”, it's not offensive – it's actually respectful. But remember that it/its pronouns have a history of transphobic use, so only with people who explicitly wish it.
